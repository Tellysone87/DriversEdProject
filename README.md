<img src = "/TitleScreenShot.png" width = "400">

This is my project from my advanced coding class.The purpose of this project was to create a game that was not only playable but it also had to teach the user something. I decided to create a drivers ed traffic sign game. This is my second project using C# and Unity game engine. The game function includes keyboard and mouse input. The user can manuveur a car with breaks and steering. and It has score keeping and triggers to control scenes.  This is a work in progress and I will continue to update and add more features.
